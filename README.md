So far i have learned the basic stractural HTML elements, like headings, paragraph, lists, file structure and embedding images. I have tried to apply all the things I have learnd so far to complete this project.

I have learned CSS over the past days. At this moment I have applied some style (if you call it so) to my HTML. I have tried to position things using Inline-block and block display properties. I have used margin, padding an border to lay out things nearly to what i wanted. i have used try-and-error kind measurment style in my box-model.
